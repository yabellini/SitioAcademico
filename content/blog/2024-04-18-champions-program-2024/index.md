> We are thrilled to launch our Champions Program pilot!

## Why a Champions Program?

Champion programs are designed to identify, recognize, and reward passionate community members.

At rOpenSci, we recognize that there is a dismaying lack of diversity in the ecosystem of research software and open source communities. The R Community is no exception; its developers are overwhelmingly white, male, and from a handful of countries. This disappointing lack of diversity is potentially detrimental to the sustainability, utility and productivity of projects. 

We also know that communities of practice can drive meaningful change. We understand the importance of supporting a diverse cohort of community leaders and contributors to all aspects of research software creation as they strive to transform our ecosystem for the better.

The rOpenSci Champion Program [is part of a series of activities and projects we are carrying out to ensure our research software serves everyone in our communities](https://ropensci.org/blog/2021/12/20/inclusive-leadership-program/), which means that it needs to be sustainable and open, and built __by and for all groups.__

That is why this program focuses on __people who belong to groups that are historically and systematically excluded__ from the open software and research software communities and who are interested in contributing to rOpenSci and the broader ecosystem of open source and research software communities.

## What is our Champions Program?

We have developed a **12-month-long program including cohort-based training, project development, and personal mentorship**. 

Champions will participate in a 6-week long cohort-based training on a) planning and facilitating engaging and inclusive workshops to support participants’ success, b) knowledge of various channels through which new members can engage in and contribute to rOpenSci and R projects, and c) technical skills in software development and review. 

After training, Champions will develop their project, which can be one of the following options:

* Create a new package;
* Go through the review process with an R package they have already developed;
* Serve as a reviewer for the rOpenSci software peer review system.

Mentors may also support Champions with delivering other activities including: giving a talk, writing blog posts, and teaching other community members.

We will provide a $1000 (USD) stipend to the selected community champions.

You can see all details on our [Champions Program webpage](https://ropensci.org/champions/).
