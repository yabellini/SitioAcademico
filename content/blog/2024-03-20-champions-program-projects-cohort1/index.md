We are excited to share the progress and achievements of the first cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program. This initiative, aimed at empowering individuals from underrepresented groups in the open source and research software communities, has seen remarkable projects and contributions from its participants.

## Overview of the Champions Program

The rOpenSci Champions Program is designed to provide mentorship, training, and support to individuals passionate about contributing to open source and research software. By focusing on underrepresented groups, the program aims to foster a more diverse and inclusive community.

## Projects Highlights

The first cohort of the Champions Program has worked on a variety of projects, ranging from developing new R packages to enhancing existing ones and contributing to the rOpenSci review process. Here are some highlights:

### New Package Development

Several champions have taken on the challenge of developing new R packages to address gaps in research software tools. These packages are currently under review in the rOpenSci software review system, showcasing the practical impact of the program.

### Package Enhancement

Other participants have contributed to improving existing R packages, adding new features, fixing bugs, and enhancing documentation. Their work not only benefits the immediate users of these packages but also sets a precedent for collaborative development.

### Contribution to Review Process

A unique aspect of the Champions Program is encouraging participants to engage in the rOpenSci software review process. Some champions have served as reviewers, providing valuable feedback and insights to help improve the quality of submissions.

## Looking Forward

The success of the first cohort of the rOpenSci Champions Program is a testament to the potential of targeted mentorship and training initiatives to drive meaningful contributions to the open source and research software communities. We look forward to the continued growth and impact of this program in future cohorts.
