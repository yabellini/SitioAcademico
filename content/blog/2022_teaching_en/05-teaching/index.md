## Videoconferencing platform gets temperamental

For the delivery of synchronous online classes we had to use videoconferencing software. There are several commercial options, for example [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) o [Meet](https://workspace.google.com/intl/es-419/products/meet/) and free and open source software, such as [JitSi](https://meet.jit.si/).

For all of them we had to learn how to use them and *tame them*. Today's installment presents situations that occurred in classrooms and on-line events related to *videoconferencing platforms* and how we solved them.

Some of the situations presented are general and apply to any platform, but you will see that many solutions (and problems) are specific to Zoom, which is the platform I use the most to teach classes and have meetings and conferences.

As a general tip **it is always a good idea to do a test run beforehand** the event to see how all the tools work (microphone, camera, mouse, tablet, audio, screen sharing, playing the audio or video, editing the shared document, streaming to a video platform, etc).

## Alternative platform

The first solution to some platform problems is to have a contingency platform:

- [JitSi](https://meet.jit.si/) is a good option because it is free, does not require *login* and you can create a room fairly quickly.

- In Argentina most people connect using a cell phone and one of the most used platforms is *WhatsApp*. Video calling (or text and audio messaging) on this platform is an option that can include many people. In addition they do not have to install and learn to use the software.

- [Discord](https://discord.com/) appears as a very good option because it has text, audio, sound and video all in one.  It is also quite simple to set up.

- [Meet](https://workspace.google.com/intl/es-419/products/meet/) was another platform used to teach classes, especially since it was free to use during the pandemic.

## I can't share what I want

In classes we usually share materials such as presentations, videos and those of us who teach programming show our software development environment. We usually do this by sharing the screen, but we don't always show what we want.

### General rule

**Close everything that I don't want to be displayed**: messaging applications, windows of other programs and tabs of other websites.  In addition to not displaying what I do not want, we will avoid unwanted interruptions with notifications and distracting content that does not correspond to the class.

### Share the presentation (Teacher)

If I don't have the permissions to share (and no one can give them to me) we can:

- see if the person teaching with us or the tech support person can share and pass the presentation for us.

- Send the presentation via email or share the link to the presentation via chat and ask students to follow along on their devices while you indicate *next* out loud, each time they have to change slides.

> **It is always a good idea to share the presentation beforehand** This helps people who use assistive technology (e.g., screen readers), are not native speakers of the language of the presentation, have to connect from a device with a very small screen, and previewing the material helps them.

### Screen sharing (Learners)

If students are the ones who want to share:

- Check that they have the appropriate permissions to share.

- If you are working in zoom group rooms, make sure that the *Several participants can share simultaneously* is enabled or *only one person in the entire meeting* will be able to share

### Share Videos.

We can share a video in different ways:

- *Local player with the copy of the video on our machine.*  To have to share not only the screen but also the sound of the computer or the video so that in addition to being seen it can be heard.

- If this does not work we can *upload the video on some platform* such as [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com) o [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) (with private or hidden link) and share that link for each person to see it individually.

> It is a good idea to generate an account or channel for the subject, in case teachers do not want to use their personal channel to upload this material.

## I can't use this tool

- It is always a good practice *to test everything we want to use before the class* we need to make sure that *include in the test the use of the applications and tools from a tablet and a cell phone.*.  This way we will know *if our students can do what we are asking them to do.* y *we will be able to give instructions* on where the controls are or how to switch from one screen to another using a different device.

- It is also recommended *not to assume and ask before the course starts what tools they know and what tools they have.*.  This will help *select the most suitable elements* for our group.  It is also essential to show how to use the selected tools, it will serve to learn for those who do not know and as a review for those who know the technology.  It can even be done in specific groups to level the use and knowledge of the tools.

- Leaving the option of connecting from the browser enabled is a good alternative in case the desktop software fails (Zoom has several problems with Linux).

- Sometimes our students will not have a camera and/or microphone, in this case just check that they can hear and see us, and *remind them of the other ways to participate* such as writing in the chat, in the shared class document or in the forum (either campus, Slack or Discord). If they have another device they can connect with that second device, e.g. computer and cell phone.

## Security Issues

Although many of the initial security issues were resolved during the pandemic, if we are faced with a situation where a person enters our meeting and engages in inappropriate behavior we can:

- remove them from the meeting:
  
  - Send you to the waiting room,
  
  - Remove him/her from the meeting (he/she will not be able to rejoin),
  
  - Report the user to Zoom.

If we cannot remove it then cut the session and reconvene.

Always refer to the **code of conduct** and leave a record of what happened for the incident report.

## Accessibility

### Subtitles

Automatic subtitles in video conferences can be a headache, especially if you speak in a language other than English (which is the default) or speak English with an accent (like me).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Other little things happen when you organize a trilingual conference with more Spanish and Portuguese speakers, but all the tools assume English is the default language.<br><br><br>Zoom&#39;s subtitles during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LatinR2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LatinR2020</a> are delirious.<br><br>We are very sorry for this. <a href="https://t.co/bbHGC04288">https://t.co/bbHGC04288</a> <a href="https://t.co/WvlFP5Y8YN">pic.twitter.com/WvlFP5Y8YN</a></p>&mdash; Yanina Bellini Saibene (@yabellini) <a href="https://twitter.com/yabellini/status/1580237353787850765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

> Translation of tweet: *Other little things happen when organizing a trilingual conference with more Spanish and Portuguese speakers, but all the tools assume that English is the default language. Zoom's subtitles on LatinR are delusional.  We are very sorry for that.*

In Zoom you can configure the list of languages so that only the languages that will be spoken are available. Unfortunately to switch from one language to another on this platform, it is sometimes necessary to leave the meeting and re-enter.

If what you need is to add subtitles to your videos, [you can follow this step-by-step I wrote for useR! 2022](https://user2022.r-project.org/participate/generate-captions/) (in English).

### Simultaneous translations

The simultaneous translation option allows people who speak different languages to understand each other.  It is now an option for Zoom Pro accounts with the Webinar option.  Activation must be requested in advance of the event.

## Synchronous meetings

The mode of synchronous classes has been the most used and Zoom and Meet are the two most chosen platforms for these meetings.

The above list presents situations in the classroom and in conferences. I hope you find it useful to know them, both in your role as teachers and students, since online classes and events are here to stay.

I look forward to hearing about your experiences with these platforms in the comments.
